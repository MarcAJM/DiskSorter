        Push it to the limit
        Walk along the razor's edge
        But don't look down just keep your head, or you'll be finished

        Open up the limit
        Past the point of no return
        Reached the top, but still you gotta learn how to keep it

        Hit the wheel and double the stakes
        Throttle wide open like a bat outta hell
        You could crash the gates (crash the gates)

        Going for the back of beyond
        Nothing gonna stop you, there's nothing that's wrong
        So close now you're nearly at the brink
        So push it, ooh yeah

        Welcome to the limit (the limit)
        Take it baby, one step more
        The power game's still playing so you better win it

        Push it to the limit (the limit)
        With no one left to stand in your way
        You might get careless, but you'll never be safe
        While you're still livin'

        Welcome to the limit (the limit)
        Standing on the razor's edge
        So don't look down just keep your head, or you'll be finished

        Welcome to the limit
        Push it to the limit, hey!
